                <h2>Who are We?</h2>
                <p>In 2018, a group of around 50 peace leaders, from different countries around the world came for a peace building camp for one week in the city of Duhok. Another 50 people from Iraq joined the camp, from backgrounds and religions. After this camp we found it very valuable to keep the same idea, principles and values that we learn in that camp to keep it alive and impact others. Therefore, in 2020 August 15  a core group of (two Christians, two Muslims and two Yazidis) noticed gender balances by having three females and three males decide to find progress in peace. Our NGO focus is on development and relief when needed. The NGO is based in Sinjar Area. </p>

                <p>Progress in Peace is a group of youth from different backgrounds and religions. We will keep this form as we grow bigger because we believe that all humans are equal and diversity is the key to developing our country.

Our hope is to help women and youth to play a bigger role in our lives. We hope to restore love and social cohesion to our country.
